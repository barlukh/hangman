"""
*Welcome to play the 'Hangman' game! This is my first project ever after studying Python for a month.*
The computer generates a hidden random word (noun) and the player tries to reveal the word by guessing the letters of the word.
The player can see the length of the word and the revealed letters in their respective positions.
If a guess is wrong, the computer proceeds to draw a part of a 'Hangman'. Revealed letters are drawn to their positions.
If the computer completes the drawing, the player loses. The player wins if he reveals the whole word before he is 'hanged'.
